Description:
This custom keyboard was created to speed up my 3D CAD development. My 60 most used commands are now just a click or two away. The keyboard is fully customizable, uses standard components and is easy to replicate since it does not use a PCB, instead everything is 3D printed using the 3DPCB idea.

Features
- 33 keys (5×6+3)
- Easy to customize (printable keycaps with laminated paper inlay)
- Anyone can build it using a 3D-printer (FFF/FDM), common components and a soldering iron.
- QMK firmware (allowing advanced keyboard layout)
- Replaceable keycaps – twist and release
- Using common 6x6mm TACT switches
- Anti-ghosting using 1N4148 diodes
- No PCB required (everything is 3D printed)
- Low activation force (depending on switches)
- Ergonomic – half size keyboard enables shoulder width position of hands.

Bill of Materials (BOM)
- 1x Arduino pro micro (or clone)
- 33x 6x6mm tact switches (low actuation force)
- 33x 1N4148 Diodes (can be omitted, with risk of key ghosting when pressing multiple keys)
- Strands of 0.3mm copper wire (from RK Cable)
- PLA for 3D printer
- Micro USB cable
